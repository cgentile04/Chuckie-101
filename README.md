3. A navigation bar at the top of the site (click on it and it takes you to different sections)
4. A game (linked in the navigation bar) for the user to play that is related to me in some way (I played Doodle Jump when I was little)

What was not delivered/what I would implement if I had more time:
1. A built-in calculator for basic math (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
2. A built-in timer
3. A background that constantly changes colors
4. A glowing title at the top (constantly changing colors)
